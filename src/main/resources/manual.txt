MAIN:
Pick the desired tool.

DISCOVER:
The tool Discover takes one or more .txt files as input and processes them into a Business Domain Language (BDL).
It can also confront an already created BDL and a collection of already written Gherkin scenarios to check how well they match.

DESIGN:
The tool Design takes a .scenario file and processes it into a Business Application Language (BAL).
During the process it's possible to change the return types of the found methods and the types of the found parameters.

DEVELOP:
The tool Develop takes a .json file, written in the OpenAPI specification, and processes it into the stub of an API and it's relative tests.
In our case the .json is the BAL created in the Design tool.

BDL:
The Business Domain Language (BDL) is a list of nouns, verbs and predicates and their relative frequency.
A stakeholder can use this list to write better Gherkin scenarios or to verify how well they match the Domain Language.

GHERKIN:
A file .scenario contains the scenarios that a stakeholders wants to represent in the desired product.
These scenarios are written with the Gherkin keywords "Given - When - Than - And", like described in the User Manual.

BO:
A Business Ontology (.BO) is a file used to import complex types during the creation of the BAL.

BAL:
The Business Application Language (BAL) is a .json file written accordingly to the OpenAPI specification.
It acts as an intermediate step between the natural language and the API.

PLA:
The Programming Language Adapter (PLA) is a file that describes the desired syntax of a programming language.
PLAs for the languages Java and Javascript are already included within the tool and more can be imported by creating them
according to the guidelines described in the User Manual.
